# Martinez Assignment 3
## Statistical Learning Methods

This topic covered Gradient Descent and Multivariate Discriminant Analysis.

This assignment did not have any code, just forumlas so there is no additional text. The only document in here is a PDF of the formulas and the responses to the question.
